# DBeaverPasswordDecoder

This is a fork af this file: https://github.com/so-random-dude/oneoffcodes/blob/master/SimpleStringEncrypter.java

I have added a simple GUI just to write each time a different key without the need to modify, compile and run the code bay yourself.

The original question was here on StackOverflow:
